# Three-Worlds
## Description
Work-in-progress.
CLI text-based adventure game with three different worlds/storylines (currently the first world is unavailable so choose burgers 2 or 3).
Time-constraints meant that some content may be missing (such as a fulfilling ending, but I'd argue the journey is more important).
Big risk of crashing in world 2 if you type an invalid input so stick to integers that are within the bounds of each question in that world.

## Installation and Usage
- `npm install`
- `node index.js`
